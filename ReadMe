Finding Ball Speed Assignment
**********************
To measure the speed vector of the baseball.

The extra information is as follow:
1) There are 15 images in the folder. There are taken at a fixed interval of 240fps. The camera extrinsic is as follow:
2) Pixel size 0.0048mm
3) Full resolution 1280x1024
4) Focal length FL 8mm
5) Radius of baseball  0.0373 meter.
6) The camera is tilted 10 degree upwards towards the sky. It is sitting on the ground 4 meters away from where the ball starts.

Technical details 
=================
1) Background subtraction - Adaptive Gaussian mixture based background foreground segmentation
2) Hough Circles 
3) Local Binary Pattern for pattern Matching
4) Canny and convolution for circle fitting
5) Linear Least squares - for line fitting and curve fitting.
6) 

Along with this project the following files are attached
========================================================
1) Source files : CamIntrinsicExtrinsicConst.h, common.h, detectAndTrack.cpp, detectAndTrack.h, MatchingAlgos.cpp, MatchingAlgos.h, RefineBallPos.cpp, RefineBallPos.h, SpeedCalculation.cpp, SpeedCalculation.h, main.cpp

2) install.sh (To check if cmake is installed, if not install and build the project)
3) images folder with 15 images (input for the Algorithm)
4) Template (Template of the ball)

=====================
How to install.
=====================
1) Download the BallSpeed.zip and unzip.
2) cd BallSpeed/
3) ./install.sh

=====================
How to run
